# Less Gems, More Awesome

## by Nick Gauthier

### Abstract

I love gems. We all love gems. Gems are great. But the core requirement of any gem is that it abstracts a piece of functionality out into a general re-useable library. Sometimes that extra generalization can cause an explosion in complexity both in the gem library and in the client code that leverages it. In this talk weâ€™ll look at hand-rolled replacements for a number of common gems and weigh the pros and cons of a generalized library versus a specific implementation.

### Additional Notes

I will keep "hating on gems" to an absolute minimum. This is about observing and weighing tradeoffs, not "durrrr, this gem sucks!"
