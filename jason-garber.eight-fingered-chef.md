# The Eight-fingered Chef #

## by Jason Garber ##

### Abstract ###

Chef is a great tool for managing a vast and complicated server
infrastructure, but what if you have fewer servers than fingers? What if
you just want a simple little box to host a Rack app? Maybe a staging
server to match or a CI server?

With little or no prior knowledge of Chef, you can set up a server
fairly quickly if you know the right way to set up your kitchen. (They
don’t make it obvious; I’ve lost a few fingers in the process.) We’ll
walk through the basics of Vagrant, Chef-solo, Knife-solo, using
community cookbooks, and writing your own simple cookbooks.

### Additional Notes ###

This talk is great for developers who have almost no Chef experience and
could benefit from an intro to the concepts of disposable servers,
virtualization, and an infrastructure that is repeatable,  testable, and
scalable. We ruby developers are used to finding code on GitHub, having
a package manager (Rubygems<->Berkshelf), and using DSLs to declare
resources (e.g. Rake), so why are so many developers still provisioning
servers by hand? This talk aims to change that.

Similar to talk given at Philly.rb in April, 2013.
