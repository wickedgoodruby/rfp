# Writing DSLs with Parslet #

## by Jason Garber ##

### Abstract ###

A well-designed DSL improves programmer productivity and communication
with domain experts. The Ruby community has produced a number of very
popular external DSLs--Coffeescript, HAML, SASS, and Cucumber to name a few.

Parslet makes it easy to write these kinds of DSLs in pure Ruby. In this
talk you’ll learn the basics, feel out the limitations of several
approaches and find some common solutions. In no time, you’ll have the
power to make a great new DSL, slurp in obscure file formats, modify or
fork other people’s grammars (like Gherkin, TOML, or JSON), or even
write your own programming language!

### Additional Notes ###

Jason has learned much about parsing since finishing whytheluckystiff’s
RedCloth Ragel rewrite in 2008. He’s explored a number of parsing
libraries and approaches, used Parslet to do natural language parsing
for client work, and is currently rewriting RedCloth in Parslet. Jason
is a Ruby developer at PromptWorks in Philadelphia.
