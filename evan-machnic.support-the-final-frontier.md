# Support: The Final Frontier #

## by Evan Machnic ##

### Abstract ###

So many companies are writing some kickass applications these days. They put
months into designing, developing, and scaling the applications. After the
applications are out in the wild, these companies also come to the realization
that they have not thought about one of the most important parts: support
for the applications. This talk focuses on one a very important but often
neglected part of a company and ways to make sure you can have an awesome
Support organization.

### Additional Notes ###

I have been working with Ruby since 2008 and currently work in Application
Support at Engine Yard. We support some very large customers and ensure
that they're applications meet their customers' demands.
