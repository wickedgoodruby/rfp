# Backbone + Rails = <3

## by Nick Gauthier

### Abstract

At this point we’ve figured out how to use Rails appropriately to serve a client-server web application. But new JavaScript frameworks are taking the world by storm. On one end of the spectrum we have Rails purely acting as an API, but that would negate a lot of the work that has been put into server-side gems and patterns that are real time savers. In this talk we’ll look at how to leverage Backbone.js with Rails not as a full-on front-end replacement, but as a front-end augmentation tool to optimize user experience.

### Additional Notes

I'm sticking hard to Rails Asset Pipeline unobtrusive js style. This is backbone code in the style of rails javascript.
