# Have your cake and eat it too with JRuby #

## Chris Nelson ##

### Abstract ###

Ruby is a language specifically designed to make programmers happy. But when it's too slow, handles concurrency poorly, or doesn't give us adequate performance optimization tools, that makes us sad. Come hear about how JRuby can turn your frown upside down. With examples taken from real world experience, hear about how JRuby can:

   * Leverage java specific APIs (in ruby!) to get needed performance on your "hot spots"
   * Figure out exactly how much memory your code is using, down to the level of "this object is using this many bytes"
   * Do background and parallel processing with trivial amounts of effort

The bottom line is you don't have to ditch ruby to get the performance you need -- and be happy doing it!
