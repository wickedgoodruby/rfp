# Naming is Hard! #

## by Jon Yurek ##

### Abstract ###

Coming up with a good name is one of the hardest things to do in programming.
It's one of the least technical things we do, but it has one of the largest
impacts on how understandable our code is. Ruby is a very expressive language,
which makes it very suitable to naming things well and thereby making
maintenance easier. This talk will go over more than just how to name variables
and classes: it will show how to extract and name concepts, processes, and
procedures from existing code in order to understand it better.

### Additional Notes ###

This isn't specifically a "Ruby" talk, but I wouldn't have learned these lessons
without having switched to Ruby 8 years ago.
