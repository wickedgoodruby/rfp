# Creativity with Ruby-Processing #

## by Joanne Cheng ##

### Abstract ###


Many of us are developers working in great jobs that can, after a while, cause our minds to settle into habits. We work so hard to make deadlines that sometimes we forget to step out of our comfort zones. Enter Processing: Processing is a programming environment where developers can easily create images, animations, and visually interactive programs. A developer can break out of a rut by expressing themselves with beautiful interactions and visualizations through code. Out of the box, the
Processing environment requires Java programming skills.

Ruby-Processing is a simple wrapper for the Processing framework that combines the visual-driven environment of Processing with the fun of writing Ruby. In this talk, we'll go through the ways to "sketch" with Ruby-Processing with several live coding examples and create something together. Through creativity, we can increase the breadth of problems we can solve in our day to day jobs.
