# Towards Tooling; A Look at What is Missing From Our Toolbox

## by Loren Segal

### Abstract

You can usually judge the maturity of a programming language ecosystem by the
breadth of its tooling. For example, Java has a plethora of IDEs that each,
in turn, have many well maintained refactoring and code quality plugins (like
FindBugs and PMD). C/C++ is equally well established in this space. Even
JavaScript is becoming well represented, with a number of static code
analyzers and language supersets (like Dart and TypeScript) aimed at improving
tooling in the language. But where is Ruby in all of this? This talk will shed
some light on the existing tools available in the Ruby world as well as some
new tools just starting to be built out in the areas of static analysis,
formal verification, and code quality checking. We will look at what kind of
tools the Ruby community is good at building, what kind of tools we are bad at,
and most of all, some of the tooling we should be working on to really improve
our ecosystem and drive more developers to this wonderful language.

### Additional Notes

The talk will focus on all of the tooling work that is currently being done in
the Ruby community, and also the things we are *not* doing but should be. I
will highlight some of the novel Ruby tools that are pushing boundaries, but
also talk about great tools from other languages that we should be trying to
emulate (and why). Overall, I want to rekindle our community's love of
automation and tooling in hopes that we can start building towards a Ruby that
has first-class tool support and rivals the support found in other languages--
or, at the very least, keeps up with the pace of up and coming languages like
JS, so that we don't get left in the dust.

I also plan on demoing some work in progress static analysis / test case
generation tools that I am personally working on in Rubinius and JRuby (using
symbolic execution frameworks from the Java and LLVM worlds).
