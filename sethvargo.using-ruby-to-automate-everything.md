Using Ruby to Automate Your Life
================================

### Abstract
You probably use Ruby everyday, so why not use Ruby to automate some common tasks?
What if you could spin up an EC2 instance and have it automatically configure your
web server, database, users, and more? What if you could effectively capture and
replicate your production environments reliably and consistently? What if you could
then give developers production-like environments as Virtual Machines, with no
additional work? What if you could set up your new laptop with multiple Ruby versions,
your favorite software, and even change the desktop background - from a single command?
The good news is - you can!

Chef is a configuration management and automation tool that solves these problems and
many more. In this talk, you'll learn common just how easy it is to capture your
infrastructure in Chef. Save time and money by using Chef's Ruby DSL to "define" your
laptop.

How many times have you bought a new laptop and realize just how much stuff you
installed over the years? If you're using Chef, run a single command and all your 
favorite Applications, Preferences, and even passwords are back in place. And the best
part - because Chef is written in Ruby, you get to continue using the language you love!

### Additional Notes
Disclaimer: I work for Opscode, but this is not a sales pitch. I'm demonstrating a tool
that can save time and money. Plus is really fun!

I think this talk is really valuable information to Rubyist. Many similar Ruby conferences
(like Mountain West) have created a separate track for "DevOps". This new movement is
really gaining light in the community and I think showcasing a tool in the DevOps
world would be a nice change of pace.
