# Sinatra Prime

## by Zachary Scott

### Abstract

Have you tried Sinatra yet? I will bet that you've at least heard of it, or made a small app before.

Suited for the Ruby newbies and Sinatra pros alike, this talk will help you surpass common pitfalls and get your app ready for primetime.

The most common concerns are testing, scaling, and organizing your Sinatra app.

Allow me to show you a bit of magic that will help your app stand the test of time.

Ruby-core member Zachary Scott is a long time contributor to Sinatra, and author of the Sinatra recipes project.

### Additional Notes ###

I look forward to seeing you all in October!
