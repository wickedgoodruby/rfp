# Chipping Away at Enterprise #

## by Robert Jackson ##

### Abstract ###

Over the years 'enterprises' have become quite entrenched in their opinions about software development. Many corporations even forbid internal development completely! Unfortunately, this means that using ruby can be quite a challenge for many of us. 

This talk will show you how to navigate 'enterprisey' barriers to development by examining the following questions: What are some ways to really open the corporate decision-maker's eyes to what is possible with ruby? How can we sneak ruby into production without running into typical roadblocks? How can we use small simple applications to make a huge difference in our internal business processes?

### Additional Notes ###

As an in-house developer for a large corporation with a formal policy forbidding any application development I have been through the wars. I would like to help other rubyists 'beard the lion' and come through unscathed.
