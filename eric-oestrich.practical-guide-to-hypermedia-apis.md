# Practical Guide to Hypermedia APIs #

## by Eric Oestrich ##

### Abstract ###

Hypermedia APIs are a step beyond RESTful APIs: they set you up well for the future of your  API and versioning, and also help you create stable, elegant code. I'll walk you through how building a hypermedia API helped me in a recent project, and how we're using it for a new project.

### Additional Notes ###

I am a software developer at SmartLogic Solutions. I work on developing APIs and Android applications. I have spoken at my local Baltimore meetup, Bâ€™more on Rails, as well as Philly.rb and DCRug.
