# Sustainable BDD

## by Matt Parker and Robbie Clutton

### Abstract ###

The BDD hype cycle is over. Recently, there’s been a lot of backlash against 
popular BDD libraries like Cucumber. Some developers blame their test frameworks 
for brittle test suites and long build times. Others go so far as to claim that 
acceptance testing is simply not sustainable, period. 

In this talk, we’ll do some root cause analysis of this phenomenon with shocking 
results - it’s not the test framework, it’s not the methodology, it’s you. 
You’ve abused your test framework, you’ve cargo-culted the methodology, and 
now you’re feeling the pain. 

We’ll show you a way out of the mess you’ve made. We’ll discuss the main problems 
BDD was intended to solve. We’ll show you how to groom your test suite tests in order 
to address build times. We’ll teach how to mitigate against brittleness and flickers, 
and how to let your tests reveal the intent of the application and actually become the 
executable documentation we’ve been waiting for.

Over the past five years, Matt Parker has practiced BDD and collaborative specification by example at a variety of companies - from a multinational financial corporation spanning the globe and employing 80,000 people, to a self-funded two person startup. He's made all of the mistakes there are to make, but thankfully learned a thing or two along the way. He's now an agile consultant at Pivotal Labs where he helps clients get the most out of BDD.
