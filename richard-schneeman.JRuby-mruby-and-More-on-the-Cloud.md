# JRuby, mruby and More on the Cloud #

## Richard Schneeman ##

### Abstract ###


Who cares about features in that exciting new language if you can't get it to run in production. At Heroku we run millions of Ruby apps, and are adding support for new languages like JRuby every day. Discover how we architected our platform to allow all these languages to run, and how you can get any language like mruby running on Heroku. We'll then dive into a Rails app and get it to run on JRuby in production and look at some real world performance examples. Whether you compile nightly builds of Topaz, or you're not sure what MRI stands for: you're guaranteed to walk away with a better understanding of running different rubies on the cloud.


### Additional Notes ###

Richard is married to Ruby since 2013, programming Ruby since 2006, and teaching Rails since 2010. He works at Heroku and lectures at the University of Texas, and yes: his wife's name is Ruby. He enjoys obsessively playing Starcraft 2 and writing gems such as Wicked, Sextant, and oPRO. He loves open source and wrote http://www.codetriage.com to help people get involved with their favorite Github repos.
