# Is Postgres the future of Open SQL #

## by Harold Gim√©nez ##

### Abstract ###

Most ruby and Rails :tm: developers use an SQL database
to let their objects rest until they're needed again.
Oftentimes, this database is Postgres.

This talk will arm you with general knowledge to be used
to more efficiently utilize PostgreSQL to fulfill your
application's OLTP load and reporting.

Basically what are some amazing postgres features that make it so sweet,
 and a bit of history on the project. It covers:

* How postgres does durability
* How you as a user can balance between durability and performance
* Advanced query constructs: CTEs, Window functions in particular
* Advanced data types
* Advanced indexing techniques
* Extensions and how/why it's the future of databases
* How postgres handles concurrency and how you can control that

You will leave this talk with a sampling of what features are
available to you from Postgres when you hit your next
complex data needs.
