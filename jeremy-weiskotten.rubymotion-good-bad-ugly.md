# RubyMotion: The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly #

## by Jeremy Weiskotten ##

### Abstract ###

RubyMotion revolutionizes the way we build native iOS apps. We can use the
development tools we're most comfortable with while leveraging the power and
expressiveness of Ruby.

RubyMotion is continuously improving and the open source ecosystem is strong
and growing. But like any new technology, it's not all roses. Experienced Ruby
developers may have preconceived notions, misconceptions, and false assumptions
about RubyMotion is and what it can do. I'll discuss what works well, where the
tools can improve, and what bothers me the most with an eye towards improving
the toolchain and ecosystem.

### Additional Notes ###

We're building a few new iOS apps at Terrible Labs with RubyMotion. As seasoned
Ruby and Rails developers, with some painful history in building iOS apps with
Objective-C as well as HTML5 apps with PhoneGap/Cordova, we're excited about the
future of RubyMotion. We'd love to share what we've learned with the community.
