# Rails 4 In Action

## by Nick Gauthier

### Abstract

Rails 4 Release Candidate 1 is out (or maybe by the time this talk is given, the release!) and it’s packed with some amazing new features, especially when it comes to performance. Nick Gauthier has been using Rails 4 for a few months now and in this talk he’s going to share some of his favorite parts. From the clearer folder structure all the way to the guts of streaming responses and websockets, we’re going to see what Rails 4 is all about.

### Additional Notes

I'll have given this talk at SpreeConf and RubyNation by the time Wicked Good happens, so I'd recommend my other talks unless this is your top pick!
