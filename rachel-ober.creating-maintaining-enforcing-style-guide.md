# Creating, Maintaining, and Enforcing a Style Guide #

## by Rachel Ober ##

### Abstract ###


No one can deny that a well-constructed Style Guide is a Good Thingâ„¢. But what happens when the main developer who constructed and maintained the style guide leaves and you're the sole front-end developer left?

At Paperless Post, I inherited responsibility for the front-end of a 4 year-old Ruby on Rails application. We have a wide variety of front-end toolsets and frameworks at our disposal that almost matches the amount of people who work on it. Allow me to share with you my trials, frustrations and solutions in dealing with the front-end challenges of a legacy Ruby on Rails application.

### Additional Notes ###

And action-oriented talk to walk through consolidating technologies and implementing a sound style guide for a development team to use.
