# RubyMotion: Under the Hood #

## by Joshua Ballanco ##

### Abstract ###

By now you probably know that RubyMotion is a new toolchain that lets you use
familiar Ruby techniques to develop applications for iOS...but do you know what
makes it tick? How is RubyMotion different from toolchains such as PhoneGap or
Titanium? What does it mean to say that RubyMotion is implemented "on top of
the Objective-C runtime"? And how the heck do I debug RubyMotion anyway?

I will attempt to answer these questions, and more, by looking deep into the
underpinnings of RubyMotion. Along the way, I'll give a bit of an overview of
the history of RubyMotion, and maybe even a glimpse at its future.

### Additional Notes ###

In the past I gave two relatively well receieved talks on MacRuby to the
Boston.rb group, and both times I was asked "What about MacRuby on iOS?" In both
cases, I had promised to give a follow-up presentation at "some point in the
future". This would be that talk, taking the same approach I did in those talks
of looking at the technology from the bottom up. This talk will be less of a
tutorial, and more of a deep dive into the heart of RubyMotion itself.
