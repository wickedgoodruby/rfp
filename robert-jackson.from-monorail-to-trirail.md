# From Monorail to Tri-rail #

## by Robert Jackson ##

### Abstract ###

Rails is so powerful that it can be easy to forget the basics of good software design. When every feature is simple to tack on to an application it is very difficult to see when you may have crossed the line. When this happens your application becomes a bloated mess.

You don't need to look far to find reference to a 'Monorail'. Is this just an odd reference to Disney World or does it actually have something to do with software development? How can you decouple your monolithic application into smaller and more distinct chunks? 

Using a number of examples from real production rails applications, this talk will examine some of the problems developers faced as the applications grew, and highlight a few strategies to address them.

### Additional Notes ###

As a developer I have fallen down the rabbit hole of simply adding on new features, only to find later that my entire codebase was a giant mess of [SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), [Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Of_Demeter), and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) violations.
