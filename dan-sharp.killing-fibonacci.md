# Killing Fibonacci #

## by Dan Sharp ##

### Abstract ###

Testing is an important part of the development lifecycle of any software solution. It is particularly important in the Ruby community with lots of real and perceived pressure to test first, test often and test fully (or at least 90% coverage, right?). However, there has not been as much focus on the _why_ of testing as a mechanism to encourage good code practices, good design decisions and coverage that is meaningful. This presentation aims to change all that. I will start with a brief overview of ruby testing: the why, what, how, when and where. For the rest of the presentation, I will take the Fibonnaci sequence and deconstruct it via a tongue-in-cheek approach to showcase why Good Testing&trade; is so much more important than Testing... and why tests should force the developer to think deeper about their code... not just as _implementation_ but as **behavior!**

*(The killing of Fibonacci will take place live. However no animals or Italian mathematicians will be harmed during the talk.)*

### Additional Notes ###

Dan is a life-long geek, having been fascinated with computers since early childhood. He cut his teeth, like many, on Java and PHP, but found Ruby via Ruby on Rails&reg; in 2005... building one of the first successful Rails-based SaaS ventures... and never looking back. These days, Dan works as Senior Software Architect with the Nexia&trade; team at Ingersoll Rand, affording him the luxury of a startup environment backed by a multi-billion dollar company. He resides in Golden, CO with his wife and two children. When not hacking code, he's usually lost in the back country somewhere, enjoying the great outdoors. He's an avid blogger and tweets all the time. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
