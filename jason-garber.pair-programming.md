# Two Brains = Happiness Squared: A pair programming primer #

## by Jason Garber ##

### Abstract ###

Youâ€™ve heard of pair programming, but does it actually work? How true
are the productivity and quality claims? And ultimately, will it make
you a happier Ruby developer?

Jason and his coworkers have perfected the pair-programming setup, found
many useful tools, and are converging on the right balance of pairing
vs. soloing. Learn from our experiments, get a jump-start with best
practices, and stock up on ammo for convincing your boss that pairing
produces better code, saves money, and keeps good developers around.

### Additional Notes ###

This talk has not been given elsewhere. I am working on a short book
about pair programming.
