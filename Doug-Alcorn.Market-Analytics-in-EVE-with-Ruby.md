# Market Analytics in EVE with Ruby #

## by Doug Alcorn ##

### Abstract ###

Ever wondered about market trading, analytics or algorithms but didn't want to lose your shirt experimenting? 
EVE Online is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) rich in data with a fully functional, 
player driven economy. Using some simple concepts and novel tools you can get access to this data and discover 
interesting things. This talk will introduce you to market analytics and the cruel world of EVE Online.

### Additional Notes ###

I've given this talk improv at our local Cincinnati.rb and it went over well. It's posted on

[http://www.reddit.com/r/evetrading/comments/1amvdp/commodity_market_analysis_with_ruby/](reddit) 
discussing it.
