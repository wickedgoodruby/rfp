# Coders in Community #

## Angela Harms ##

### Abstract ###
We are makers. A crazy & beautiful collection of nerds and 
other folks, we can't help leaving a trail of created things 
wherever we go. Alone, we create cool stuff. Together, what 
we create can be mind-blowing -- if we don't tear each other 
to shreds, first!
 
Community can be hard. As much as we want to love each other 
and work together, once in a while things fall apart. 
  
This session explores specific ways to ground yourself, come 
from a place of love, and collaborate with the weirdest, most 
annoying people.
  
### Additional Notes ###

This talk was inspired by the stuff that happened after PyCon this year.  
Someone actually asked me to submit to Wicked Good Ruby, so I am, though it 
doesn't seem to be a clear fit for what you're doing. I gather that this 
conference is mainly looking for technical talks, and further that you don't 
want talks given elsewhere. ('<-to make vim shut up about the open quote 
which is actually an apostrophe.) I expect versions of this talk to happen in 
August at Steel City Ruby and at Distill in SF. In some sense, all my talks 
are repeats of "bringing love into your work" and none of them are repeats, 
ever.

What it's not: This is not a "how to be more welcoming to women & people of 
color" talk. It's also not "here's the one right way to behave" and it's not 
"how to tell who's right and who's wrong". It's about growing as nerds and as 
people.
