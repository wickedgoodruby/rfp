# Hacking Your Home with Ruby #

## by Justin Campbell ##

### Abstract ###

15 years ago, Justin looked forward to the day when he could have a stack of expensive audio equipment with speakers in every room, lights that follow him around, and an intercom system so the family could page each other like Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

Ubiquitous networking, APIs for consumer electronics, and cheap computers like the Raspberry Pi have made it easier than ever to automate your home. We go over some popular technologies, see some code to glue it all together, and watch a live demo of some of Justin's favorite house hacks.

### Additional Notes ###

I have not given this talk anywhere else yet.
