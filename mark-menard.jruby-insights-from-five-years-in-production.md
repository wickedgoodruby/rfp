# JRuby: Insights from Six Years in Production #

## by Mark Menard ##

### Abstract ###

JRuby is the primary alternative implementation of Ruby available. With support for native threads, excellent garbage collection, and the introduction of Invoke Dynamic it has grown into a formidable platform. So, what can JRuby do for you? Learn how JRuby differs from MRI, how JRuby supports parallelism, how to use Java libraries from JRuby, how to use Ruby from Java and more. Java no longer means just the language anymore, the JVM is an excellent place to host Ruby applications.

### Additional Notes ###

My team and I have been using JRuby in production since August of 2008 starting with JRuby 1.1.2 and Rails 2.1. We have integrated JRuby and our Rails application with existing an existing Java Struts 2 application that uses JPA/Hibernate and Spring. Bringing Ruby and Rails into our JVM environment allowed flexibility in picking the best tool for the job, while maintaining compatibility with our legacy code base.
