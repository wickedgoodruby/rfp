# Creating, Maintaining, and Enforcing a Style Guide #

## by Rachel Ober ##

### Abstract ###

So you have an awesome idea—great! But you're not a designer—not so great! Where do you turn to quickly solve the issue of developing your User Interface?

Bootstrap is go-to choice for quickly styling and formatting a new website or application to get it to market quickly. But after building out your product and solidifying your brand, putting all your design choice "eggs" into one framework "basket" could lead to some messy code down the line as you try to make custom changes—not to mention, you'd probably like to have a design that doesn't look like every other web app out there! 

When you eventually want to break out from Bootstrap's canned design, it can be overwhelming deciding which toolsets to swap in. Once your project succeeds and more developers and designers are added to your team, your code base should be as flexible as you need it to be in order to offer the best experience for your users.

In this talk, we'll breakdown and inspect what Bootstrap offers and discuss other options you can use to make your code base more modular instead of depending on one option for your front-end.

### Additional Notes ###

And action-oriented talk describing tool sets that can replace Bootstrap with other technologies so that front-end developers aren't tied into one framework and subjected to its whims.
