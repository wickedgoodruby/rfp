# The Esoteric Library

## by Zachary Scott

### Abstract

Have you ever wondered what that ~20MB of code in your Ruby installation is there for? You didn't know Ruby came with a eso- standard library?! Well it totally does, and there's a lot of hidden gems in there just waiting for you to uncover.

Allow me to guide you through some of the more delightful members of the standard library. I will hand pick libraries authored by the pioneers of Ruby and show you the useful bits.

You'll discover a pure Ruby Markdown parser, practical configuration for the REPL, and distributed Ruby just to name a few.

Zachary Scott has been a Ruby committer since last Fall and will share his experiences with the standard library of MRI.

### Additional Notes ###

I look forward to seeing you all in October!
