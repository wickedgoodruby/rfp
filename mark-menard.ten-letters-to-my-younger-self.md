# Ten Letters to my Younger Self #

## by Mark Menard ##

### Abstract ###

I've been building software for longer than I care to admit. (I started on a VIC-20. Yes, I'm almost a gray head, if I had hair.) In that time I've made a lot of mistakes. Learn from my mistakes as I talk about ten letters I wish I could write to my younger developer self.

* Do not become over enamored of your new shiny tool. Everything is not a nail.
* You're not as good as you think you are. You don't know what you don't know yet. Learn harder, learn faster.
* Naming things is hard, hard, hard. You can't do it alone. You're just not that good.
* It always takes longer than you think it will. Always. And no you're not good at estimating. Here's how to get better...
* There is no accepted wisdom in software development, especially when touted by a company. Look beyond "official" standards. That's where the good stuff is.
* The latest framework, language, paradigm... these too shall pass.
* Learn Lisp. It will change how you think.
* Learn C cold. It will make you appreciate Lisp, and understand memory.
* Always hunt the error. It will come back to bite you.
* In the end successfully building software requires communication. Literate code isn't enough. Clean code isn't enough. Tests aren't enough. All the technical stuff isn't enough. Talk with your stakeholders, and learn to write literate executable specifications that communicate with your stakeholders.

### Additional Notes ###

As I say in the abstract, I've been at this a long time. I'm self taught and I really wish someone had explained these things to me when I was younger. I would have saved a lot of time, and excellerated my progress in the art of development.
