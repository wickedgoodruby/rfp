# Python for Ruby Programmers 

## by Mike Leone

### Abstract

You've probably heard of Python, the _other_ popular, dynamic, multi-paradigm 
programming language. It occupies much of the same space as Ruby, has many 
similar language features, and the syntax even looks pretty similar. But what 
are the specific strengths and weaknesses of Python when compared to Ruby? What 
use cases are conducive to one language versus the other? 

In this talk, we look at similarities and differences in the design of each 
language, exploring how they affect application development and maintenance. 
Later, we look at some specific problem domains (web development, scientific 
programming, etc) and show how much traction each language has for those 
domains.


### Additional Notes

In this talk, I'll show you that (a) jumping between Ruby and Python is very 
easy, and that (b) learning Python will make you a better Ruby Programmer.

This is a new version of my "Python for Ruby Programmers" talk. It was first  
presented at Los Angeles RubyConf 2013, and it made the front page of Hacker 
News. I received lots of useful feedback from that; this version features 
better material for advanced programmers and better idiomatic code samples.
